    <p class="quote-style">Stantonio is the best decision we made while planning our wedding. She was super responsive, flexible, funny and
      incredibly easy to work with. We knew that the photos would be the one thing we could cherish forever and
      Stantonio made sure that they were perfect. I cannot recommend Stantonio enough for your big day!</p>

    <p class="quote-style">Stantonio met and exceeded all of our expectations. I have a lot of friends who are professional photographers
      and my standards are very high. It was important to me to have someone that made me comfortable (awkward photos
      are the worst!), who listened to my wants & needs, and who could capture incredible images. I’m glad that we did
      an engagement session with Stantonio before our wedding so that we could get to know each other more and be that
      much more comfortable. not only are her images stunning, but her editing and color work are out of this world. The
      worst part of the process is having to choose which photos to print and to turn into an album because there are
      thousands of incredible photos. I’d highly recommend working with Stantonio!</p>

    <p class="quote-style">Great photography was one of the top priorities for our wedding, and Stantonio delivered spectacular memories!
      She’s also remarkably easy to work with, which is a “must have” from a photographer with all the other delightful
      chaos of a wedding.</p>

    <p class="quote-style">Stantonio is great! We immediately felt very comfortable with Stantonio and were able to relax and have fun with
      throughout the whole process. She was very organized and open to any requested we had. Her photographs were
      absolutely beautiful and each one is a masterpiece to enjoy for years to come! Stantonio is very professional and
      a pleasure to work with!</p>
